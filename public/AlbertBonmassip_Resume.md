### About me

I have been living abroad for 10 years, first in Zurich and then Los Angeles. I recently came back to Barcelona looking for new opportunities and challenges.

I am a front-end developer, experienced in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I mainly use React and Next.js to build sites, and Three.js to create 3D experiences. I also have skills in back-end, I have used Node and Express, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Because of my previous career in computer graphics as a [3D generalist](https://abonmassip.artstation.com/), I am also proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Blender and all aspects of 3D graphics.
