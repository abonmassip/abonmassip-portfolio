Tool for formatting and comparing large lists of data in multiple ways.

Built with **React**, **Redux** for state management and **Firebase** for authentication and database.

This project was born when I started learning JavaScript and made this [old prototype](https://github.com/abonmassip/compare-datasets-old) in vanilla JS, to help my wife with her science research.
