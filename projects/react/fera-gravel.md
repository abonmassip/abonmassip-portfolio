**Fera Gravel** is a site for promoting a mountain bike route in the Pyrenees.

Built in **Next.js**, responsive layout and translated to multiple languages using **next-intl**. Static pages generated from markdown files using **remark** and **gray-matter**, so the site is easy to update without touching the code.

Hosted on **netlify.com** automatically built from the **Github** repository.
