App that gets an image and detects if it has a face on it.

I used **React**, **Node** and **Express.js** for the backend, **PostgreSQL** for the database and **Clarifai API** for the image recognition features.

I also used **React Hooks**, **Tachyons** and **bcrypt**.

Hosted on a free **Heroku** account, it takes a minute to load the site.
